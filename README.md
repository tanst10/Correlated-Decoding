# Correlated-Decoding
Learning Material &amp; Reproduction of Correlated Decoding 


This work serves as a practice exercise for the beginner in QEC and stim. 

The goal is to use Stim (https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) to reproduce the results in paper 'Correlated decoding of logical algorithms with transversal gates' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03272)

We also refer to the code from 

1. Hands-on quantum error correction with Google Quantum AI by Google Quantum AI in Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-error-correction/home/module/1)
 
2. Stim introduction file (https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim)
